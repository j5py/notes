Logic Gates

    Computers work by performing binary calculations

    Logic gates are electrical components that tell a computer how to perform binary calculations
    They specify rules for how to produce an electrical output based on one or more electrical inputs

    Computers use these electrical signals to represent two binary states: either an "on" state or an "off" state


    Six common logic gates (and their truth tables)

        NOT gate

            Takes that input signal and outputs a signal with the opposite binary state

                Input       Output

                Off         On
                On          OFF


        AND gate

            Outputs an "on" signal when both the inputs are "on"

                Input A     Input B     Output

                Off         Off         Off
                Off         On          Off
                On          Off         Off
                On          On          On


        OR gate

            Outputs an "off" signal only when both the inputs are "off"

                Input A     Input B     Output

                Off         Off         Off
                Off         On          On
                On          Off         On
                On          On          On


        XOR gate (pronounced as Exclusive OR, when the number of true inputs is odd)

            Outputs an "on" signal only when one (but not both) of the inputs are "on"

                Input A     Input B     Output

                Off         Off         Off
                Off         On          On
                On          Off         On
                On          On          Off


        NAND gate (NOT-AND)

            Outputs an "off" signal only when both the inputs are "on"

                Input A     Input B     Output

                Off         Off         On
                Off         On          On
                On          Off         On
                On          On          Off


        XNOR gate (pronounced as Exclusive NOR)

            Outputs an "on" signal only when both the inputs are the same

                Input A     Input B     Output

                Off         Off         On
                Off         On          Off
                On          Off         Off
                On          On          On



How to Count in Binary

    A byte has 256 values

        The 0 is counted as a value

        128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 (maximum decimal number)


    A byte of 8 bits

        128     64      32      16      8       4       2       1


        0       0       0       0       1       0       1       0       (8 + 2 = 10)

        0       1       1       0       1       0       0       0       (64 + 32 + 8 = 104)



Abstraction

    Hides complexity by providing a common interface



Computer Architecture

    Four Main Layers of Computer Architecture

        Harware
        Operating System
        Software
        User

    The human element is a critical aspect of working as an IT support professional



Motherboard

    PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
        Holds everything in place and let's our components communicate with each other



Programs, the CPU, and Memory

    Programs
        Instructions that tell the computer what to do
        We typically store programs on durable media like hard drives

    CPU (Central Processing Unit)
        Does all the calculations and data processing, the brain of our computer
            Processes the programs faster that it can read
                So we take a copy of the programs and put them into RAM
        Registers
            CPU components
                They let us store the data that our CPU works with
            Example
                Our CPU wanted to add two numbers
                    One number would be stored in a register A
                    Another number will be stored in register B
                    The result of those two numbers will be stored in register C
        Cache
            Smaller than RAM but it lets us store data that we use often and let's us quickly reference it
                RAM isn't the fastest way we can get more data to our CPU processing
            Three different cache levels in a CPU
                L1, L2, and L3
                    L1 is the smallest and fastest cache
        Internal clock
            How does our CPU know when a set of instructions end and a new one begins?
                Our CPU has an internal clock that keeps its operations in sync
                    It connects to a special wire called a clock wire
                        When you send or receive data
                            It sends a voltage to that clock wire to let the CPU know it can start doing calculations
                        Think of our clock wires as the ticking of a clock
                            For every tick the CPU does one cycle of operations
                                A clock cycle
                Example
                    3.4 GHz refers to the clock speed of the CPU
                        Represents the maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period
                            3.4 gigahertz is 3.4 billion cycles per second
                        There's a way you can exceed the number of clock cycles on your CPU
                            It's referred to as over clocking (potentially overheating your CPU)

    RAM (Random Access Memory)
        Short term memory, randomly accessed, allowing our CPU to read from
            It stores information in a location our CPU can access it faster than they could with our hard drive

    EDB (External Data Bus)
        A row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer
            When you send a voltage to one of the wires
                We say the state of the wire is on (represented by a 1)
            If there's no voltage
                Then we say that the state is off (represented by a 0)
        Comes in different sizes
            8-bit
                Sending one byte at a time
            16-bit
            32-bit
            64-bit

    MCC (Memory Controller Chip)
        A bridge between the CPU and the RAM
            We don't send data from RAM over the EDB
                Since we can only send one line of data through the EDB at a time
                There would be way too much stuff, RAM can hold millions even billions of rows of data
            Example
                The CPU talks to the MCC and says hey I need instructions for step number 3
                The MCC finds step number 3 in RAM, grabs the data and sends it through the EDB

    Address Bus
        Connects the CPU to the MCC
            Sends over the location of the data but not the data itself
            Then the MCC takes the address and looks for the data
                And then data is sent over the EDB



CPU cache and overclocking

    Cache
        Refers to a small amount of recently used data that is stored either on hardware or in software
        Speeds up the process of accessing data in temporary storage instead of using full paths

    CPU cache
        Normally stored inside each core of the CPU
        Older computers might store CPU cache in a transistor chip
            Attached to the Motherboard
            Along with a high-speed bus connecting the chip to the CPU


    CPU levels of cache

        Level 3 cache
            The largest and slowest (however, often twice as fast as RAM)
            The first location to store data after it is transfered from RAM
            Often shared by all of the cores in a single CPU

        Level 2 cache
            Holds less data than L3 cache, but it has faster access speeds
            Holds a copy of the most recently accessed data that is not currently in use by the CPU
            Each core normally has it's own L2 cache

        Level 1 cache
            The fastest and smallest
            Holds the data currently in use by the CPU
            Each core usually has its own L1 cache


    Overclocking a CPU

        Involves three variables
            The base CPU clock frequency, often measured in GHz
            The core frequency, which is calculated by multiplying the base frequency by the CPU core multipliers
            THe core voltage, which needs to be increased in small increments to meet the increasing power demand

        Warnings on overclocking
            Can damage the computer
            Can shorten the overall lifespan of the computer and void the computer's warranty

        How to overclock a CPU safely
            Check if supported
                Check the CPU manufacturer's documentation
                Check the documentation for the computer's motherboard model
            Clean the inside of the computer
                Unplug the computer, use an anti-static wristband and compressed air to remove dust
            Ensure an appropriate CPU cooler is installed (critical)
                A stock CPU cooler is most likely insufficient
                Replace the stock CPU cooler with a liquid cooling system
            Follow the manufacturer's instructions for overclocking the CPU
                Use benchmarking software to establish a baseline for the normal performance of the computer
                Set each CPU core multiplier to the lowest value of the lowest multiplier
                    Using either the manufacturer's overclocking software (recommended) or the BIOS
                         Then reboot the computer
                Increase each CPU core multiplier by 1
                Test each increase for stability using the testing utility provided by the manufacturer
                    If the voltage appears to become insufficient
                        Increase by 0.05V
                            Do not increase above 1.4V without specialized cooling hardware
                    If the computer freezes or crashes
                        It has either become completely unstable or the CPU is not getting enough voltage
                            Use the BIOS to return to the last stable frequency
                            Or increase the voltage in 0.01V increments
                If stable, reboot the computer before attempting the next increase



CPU

    Instruction set
        A list of instructions that our CPU is able to run
        Hard-coded into our CPU
            Different CPU manufacturers may use different instruction sets
                But they generally perform the same functions

    When you select your CPU
        Make sure it's compatible with your motherboard
        There are different ways of CPUs fit on motherboards using different sockets
            Your CPU might have lots of tiny pins that are either stick out or have contact points
            Two major types of CPU sockets
                LGA (Land Grid Array)
                    An LGA socket has pins coming out of the motherboard
                PGA (Pin Grid Array)
                    A PGA socket has pins coming out of the processor itself
            The socket size may vary, so always make sure your CPU and socket are compatible beforehand



RAM

    To store data that we want to access quickly
        This data changes all the time so it isn't permanent
        Almost all RAM is volatile
            Once we power off our machines, the data stored in RAM is cleared

    Our computer is comprised of programs
        To run a program
            We need to make a copy of it in RAM so our CPU can process it


    There are a lots of types of RAM

        DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)
            The one that's commonly found in computers
            When 1 or 0 is sent to DRAM, it stores each bit in a microscopic capacitor
                This is either charged or discharged, represented by 1 or a 0
                These semiconductors are put into chips that are on the RAM and store our data


    There are also different types of memory sticks that DRAM chips can be put on

        DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module)
            The more modern sticks
            Have different sizes of pins on them


    SD RAM (Synchronous DRAM)
        This type of RAM is synchronized to our system's clock speed, allowing quicker processing of data

    DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM)
        Faster, takes up less power, and has a large capacity
            Iterations
                DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, and now, DDR4 (fastest type of short-term memory currently)

    Make sure that your motherboard is compatible with any RAM sticks that you buy



Motherboards

    Chipset
        Decides how components talk to each other on our machine
            A key component that allows us to manage data between
                CPU
                RAM
                Peripherals
                    External devices we connect to our computer (mouse, keyboard, monitor)
        Made up of two chips
            Northbridge
                Interconnects RAM and video cards
                In some modern CPUs, the Northbridge has been directly integrated into the CPU
            Southbridge
                Maintains input/output (IO) controllers
                    Like hard drives and USB devices, that input and output data

    Expansion slots
        Give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer
            If you wanted to upgrade your graphics card
                You could purchase one and install it on your motherboard through the expansion slots
        The standard for an expansion bus today is the PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect express)

    Form Factor
        Determines the amount we can put in and the amount of space we'll have
        There are different size of motherboards
            ATX (Advanced Technology Extended)
                The most common form factor for motherboards
                Comes in different sizes too
                    Full-sized ATXs in desktops
            ITX (Information Technology Extended)
                Much smaller than ATX boards
                    For example, the Intel NUC comes in three board sizes
                        Mini ITX
                        Nano ITX
                        Pico ITX



Physical Storage: Hard Drives

    Metrics

        Bit
            The smallest unit of a data storage
            Can store one binary digit, a one or a zero

        Byte
            The next largest unit of storage, which is comprised of eight bits
            Can hold a letter, number or symbol

        Kylobyte
            The next largest unit, made up of 1024 bytes


    Conversion chart

        8 bits          |   1 byte
        1024 bytes      |   1 kilobyte (KB)
        1024 kilobytes  |   1 megabyte (MB)
        1024 megabytes  |   1 gigabyte (GB)
        1024 gigabytes  |   1 terabyte (TB)


    Two basic hard drive types

        HDDs (Hard Disk Drives)
            Uses a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to read and write information
                The speed that the platter rotate allows you to read and write data faster
                    RPM (Revolution Per Minute)
            Prone to a lot more damage because there are a lot of moving parts

        SSD (Solid State Drive)
            ...
