Jasmine Fundamentals


    Suite
        Collection of test cases used to verify the behavior of a JavaScript object or function

            Two parameters
                Title and a function that implements the test suite


    Spec
        A test case within a test suite

            Two parameters
                Title and a function that implements the test case

            Includes one or more expectations that represent a true or false statement

            Spec passes if all the expectations are met


    Expectation
        An assertion of true or false

            Described as `expect` within the function that takes a value, referred to as the "toBe" value


    Matchers
        A comparison between the actual and expected values


    Describe function
        Used to group related specs

            Uses a string parameter to name the collection of specs
            Helps locate specs in large suites


    Spies
        Test double functions that can stub function and track calls and arguments

            Defined in `describe` or `it` block and removed after each spec
            Created to mimic the real object to avoid overhead costing
