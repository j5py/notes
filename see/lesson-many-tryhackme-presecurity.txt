Subnetting

    The Internet
        Router
            Switch
                Subnet
                    Computer
                    Computer
                    ...
                Subnet
                    Computer
                    ...

    Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways

        Identify the network address
        Identify the host address
        Identify the default gateway

    Subnetting provides a range of benefits, including

        Efficiency
        Security
        Full control



ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) sends two types of
messages to map IP address and MAC address together

    ARP Request
        SRC MAC...
        DST MAC...
        Who has...

    ARP Reply
        SRC MAC...
        DST MAC...
        I have...



DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

    DHCP Discover
        " IP Address? "
    DHCP Offer
        " You can have... "
    DHCP Request
        " Yes... "
    DHCP ACK
        " ...for the next 24 hours "



OSI (Open Systems Interconnection Model) encapsulation layers

    7. Application

    6. Presentation

    5. Session

    4. Transport
        TCP guarantees the accuracy of data
        UDP is much faster

    3. Network
        OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
        RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

    2. Data link
        NIC (Network Interface Card)
        MAC (Media Access Control)

    1. Physical



Some notable packet headers

    Time to Live
    Checksum
    Source Address
    Destination Address



TCP/IP protocol consists of four layers

    Application
    Transport
    Internet
    Network Interface

        Information is added to each layer of the TCP model
        as the piece of data (or packet) traverses it

        In the OSI model, a frame is at layer 2 meaning
        there is no such information as IP addresses

        About anything IP addresses,
        we are talking about packets



Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

    Crucial headers

        Source Port
        Destination Port
        Source IP
        Destination IP
        Sequence Number
        Acknowledgement Number
        Checksum
        Data
        Flag


    Establishing a TCP connection (Three-way handshake)

        SYN >>>
        <<< SYN/ACK
        ACK >>>

            DATA
        FIN (properly) | RST


    Closing a TCP connection

        FIN >>>
        <<< ACK
        <<< FIN
        ACK >>>



User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet

    Fewer headers
        Time to Live (TTL)
        Source Address
        Destination Address
        Source Port
        Destination Port
        Data


UDP is stateless

    " Request " >>>
    <<< " Response "
    <<< " Response "
    <<< " Response "
    ...



Ports

    21      FTP     File Transfer Protocol
    22      SSH     Secure Shell
    80      HTTP    HyperText Transfer Protocol
    443     HTTPS   HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure
    445     SMB     Server Message Block
    3389    RDP     Remote Desktop Protocol



VPN Technologies

    PPP
        Used by PPTP to allow for authentication and provide encryption of data
        VPNs work by using a private key and public certificate (similar to SSH)
        This technology is not capable of leaving a network by itself (non-routable)
    PPTP
        Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol allows the data from PPP to travel and leave a network
        Very easy to set up, weakly encrypted in comparison to alternatives
    IPSec
        Internet Protocol Security encrypts data using the existing Internet Protocol (IP) framework
        Difficult to set up, it boasts strong encryption
